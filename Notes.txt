to create a file using cmd in node js 
type nul > index.js
// To run the above command you need to have NodeJS installed on your system and then open
the CMD(Command Prompt) and navigate to the directory where you want to create the file
and then use the following code:</s>
const fs = require('fs'); //importing the filesystem module of node.js
let readStream = fs.createReadStream("input.txt"); //creating a readable stream
let writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt"); //creating a writable
//stream with 'output.txt' as filename
readStream.pipe(writeStream); //piping the data from input.txt to output.
console.log("Data is being copied from input.txt to output.txt");

// this is the code for creating a new file named "index.js" and writing some

now let see what exactly type in above command
1- n : it will create a new file if that file does not exist, otherwise it will 
overwrite the existing file.
2- u : it stands for update. If the file exists it will overwrite the content of the
file but the file name itself remains same.
3- > : It is used to redirect the output of one command to another command or file.
So here we are using ">" symbol to redirect the output of console.log() function to a
newly created text file named "index.js". So now when we print something using
console.log(), it will be printed into the newly created "index.js" file.
4- The text between two quotes ("text") : This is just an ordinary string which
will also be written into the file. In our case it says "Data is being copied...",
which means that the message is also getting written into the file along with other
data.
Now coming back to the original question, how can we execute these commands through
node.js? We cannot directly execute them because they are specific to Command
Prompt (cmd). But still we can achieve their functionality through node.js by using
the 'child_process' module provided by node.js. Here is how:

Synchronization, in the context of restaurant operations, involves efficiently managing customer orders. For instance, when two customers arrive simultaneously at a hotel, we first take the order of the initial customer. After transmitting the order to the kitchen, we await the completion of dish preparation by the cook. Once ready, we serve the first customer promptly. While this process may seem time-consuming, it ensures a sequential flow. In a synchronized workflow, we refrain from taking the order of the second customer until the first order is served, maintaining a systematic and organized service.

node js includes an additional data type called buffer which is not available in browser's javascript buffer is mainly used to store binary data whicle reading from the file or receiving packets over the network


So whenever we try to read the file we get this buffer data but we need to convert it into a normal string so that we can understand it easily. For converting buffer to string we use a method provided by buffers called toString(). This method takes two arguments - encoding and optional position. The first argument specifies the format in which we want to convert the buffer to string. In our case we pass 'utf8' as the encoding which represents the Unicode UTF-8 character

Here is the complete code:
var fs = require('fs');
var readStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
readStream.on('data', function(chunk) {
    // chunk contains the data read from the file so far.
    // It is a buffer.
